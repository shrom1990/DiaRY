Running test cases:
To try out the tool, the following need to be done:
1. Install Yalmip from 'http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/pmwiki.php'. I use Release-20150204.
2. Download BlusTL from 'https://github.com/vraman/BluSTL.git'. Include the ‘BluSTL/src’ into the matlab path.
3. Download CrPrSTL from 'https://github.com/dsadigh/CrSPrSTL.git'. Include the ‘CrPrSTL/src’ into the matlab path.
4. Run ‘addpath.m’
4. Open matlab and the set the parent directory of Matlab to 'ParentDirectoryOfDiagTool/DiagTool/src'.
5. You can now go to the test cases you want to try out and run them. An indetail description can be found in HSCC16TestCases.txt in HSCC2016.
